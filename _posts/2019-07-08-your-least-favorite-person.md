title: Your least favorite person
---

It's been said that we should surround ourselves with the kind of people we want to be.

But who's spending time with the folks outside that group? Who's trying to learn from those with different opinions? Who's trying to understand those with opposing perspectives? Who's seeking out the kind of people most others avoid?

It's easy to dislike someone we don't know. It's easy to dislike someone who might say things we don't want to hear. It's easy to ignore their point of view. And it's even easier to write them off as wrong (because we are obviously right).

What might happen if you took the time to get to know your least favorite person?
