# There are no limits

We are all capable of giving great effort, and we are all capable of doing incredible, even impossible, things. Yet, we tend to place limits on ourselves, or we let others decide what our limits should be.

The truth is, there are no limits. Limits only exist if we allow them to.

Imagine what it might be like to have no limits. What might we be able to achieve? What opportunities might now reveal themselves? What dreams might now become realities?

If we were to remove the limits from our lives, how might that affect us? How might that affect our family, our friends, and others we don't even know? What impact might that have on the world?

We are capable of so much more than we think we are. Let's challenge ourselves to be aware of our limits, to look beyond them, and pursue our passions, our dreams, and our purpose.
