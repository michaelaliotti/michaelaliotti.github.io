title: What it means to lead
---

It means you are a servant.

You are last in line. You do the work no one else wants to do. You are responsible for failure. You are not recognized for success. (If you do it right, you are unnoticed.)

You have no desire for individual accolades. You want others to be better than you. You do not think, act, and behave like you are leading. You think, act, and behave like you are serving.

Because you are.
