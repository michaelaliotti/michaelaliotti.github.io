# On being exceptional

It's easy to think that in order to make a difference you need to have some spectacular idea, some great project no one has thought of, or some unique approach that will bring success. But really, it's about being exceptional at the fundamentals.

Some examples include: communication, follow-through, attitude, effort, patience, persistence, etc. (There are more, of course, but you get the idea.)

You don't have to be the smartest, most experienced, most popular, etc. Just relentlessly pursue excellence in everything you do and the rest will take care of itself.

Whether it's putting out the trash, working on a top-secret project, or caring for a family member, treat it like it's the most important thing you will do. Then do it again.
