# Kind vs. nice

Being kind and being nice often get conflated, but there is a significant difference between the two.

Nice is telling people what they want to hear. Nice is going against your values to avoid upsetting someone else. Nice is focusing on how others perceive you (which is not something you can control, anyway).

But kind is different.

Kind is engaging people with honesty, truth, and love (even, and especially, when it's difficult). Kind is standing firm in your values and having faith even if someone disagrees, doesn't like it, insults you, etc. Kind is focused on an internal, humble confidence that respects all yet fears none.

So, are you being kind? Or, are you just being nice?
