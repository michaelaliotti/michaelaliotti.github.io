title: What comes first?
---

Is it your family? Your friends? Your faith? Is it your job? Getting a promotion? Attaining financial freedom? Is it having connections? The affection and attention of others? The appearance of success?

Maybe it's just to get by. Maybe it's to make others hurt the way we hurt. Maybe it's to run from our demons. Maybe it's to thrive. Maybe it's to make others happy. Maybe it's to face the world with courage.

Whatever it is, it's important that we know, because what we put our attention and focus on, we amplify. And what we put first in our lives has a direct correlation with the quality of our lives.

What are you putting first in your life?
