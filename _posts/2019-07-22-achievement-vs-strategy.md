title: Achievement vs. strategy
---

Achievement gets things done. It works hard, takes action, and is constantly doing. Strategy is focused on getting the right things done. It analyzes, sets goals, and looks for areas of improvement.

Achievement wants to finish. It wants to accomplish something and move on to the next thing. Strategy knows nothing is ever finished. It loves the process and delivers continuously.

But achievement and strategy need each other. One is not fully functional without the other. Achievement without strategy has no direction. And strategy without achievement has no execution.
