title: Just Start

That idea you have. That project you need to work on. That task you don't want to do that you know needs to be done. Just start. The sooner you do, the sooner you'll be where you want to be. The key to finishing is starting.

Where would you be right now if you had started on your idea, project, or task yesterday? Last week? Last month? A year ago? If you're always going to wait for the right time, you're always going to miss it.
