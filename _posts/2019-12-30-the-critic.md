title: The Critic
---

You're not good enough; not smart enough; not tough enough. You've never done it before. You don't know what you're doing. You don't have the experience. You don't have what it takes. You don't belong. It's not possible. It can't be done. No one has done it before. Your idea is crazy; stupid; worthless. Nobody cares. And besides, you've failed before. What makes you think you'll succeed?

This is the critic. The voice of doubt. The voice of self-destruction masked as self-reasoning. The goal of the critic is to keep us from realizing our true potential, our true selves. This potential already exists within us all, lying dormant, untouched, and untapped. The voice of the critic is loud, and it's nearly impossible not to hear. But what if we just stopped listening?
