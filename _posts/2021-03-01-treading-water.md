We work so hard to keep things the same; often harder than if we were to simply embrace change. People say, "We're in unprecedented times." And they're right: we're always in unprecedented times.

Nothing that has happened (or is happening, or will happen) will ever happen again. Each moment will leave us just as quickly as it came. And so our efforts to go back to the way things used to be are misplaced.

We should be focused on moving forward because change cannot be stopped. Either we change for good, or we remain the same and get left behind. Life isn't about staying in the same place.
