Maybe you'll get that project done. Maybe you'll go to the gym. Maybe you'll cook dinner tonight. Maybe you'll call a friend. Maybe you'll do something for yourself. Maybe you'll do something for someone else.

Maybe. Maybe not.

But maybe is a nothing answer. It's a fail-safe and a shield. Maybe lets us off the hook. Maybe has no accountability, takes no responsibility, and is non-committal. Maybe doesn't set healthy boundaries.

Avoid maybe. Life is much better when we're clear on what we will and won't do.
