title: The eternal
---

If we live for the world, we will fall away from the eternal; but if we live for the eternal, the world will fall away from us --- and we will no longer desire that which is temporary, but rather that which is forever. For, to pursue the world is to pursue death, but to pursue the eternal is to pursue life.
