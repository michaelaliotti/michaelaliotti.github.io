title: Kind, understanding, and helpful
---

Is there a time when we shouldn't be kind? (And being kind doesn't mean being a pushover or making others feel good about themselves.)

Is there a time when we shouldn't be understanding? (And being understanding doesn't mean agreeing with others or being their friend.)

Is there a time when we shouldn't be helpful? (And being helpful doesn't mean saying yes to everything or putting others before ourselves.)

Don't confuse being kind, understanding, and helpful with being nice, compliant, and ingratiating. How will you know the difference?
