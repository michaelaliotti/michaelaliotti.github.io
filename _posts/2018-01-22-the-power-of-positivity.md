title: The power of positivity
---

Positivity is not acting cheerful despite difficult or challenging moments. It is not pretending to be happy even when we're not. And it is not something that should be faked or forced.

True positivity is the confidence we have in ourselves that we will find a way to keep moving forward. It is the result of knowing with a deep conviction that we will never quit.

The power of positivity is the impact it has --- not just on ourselves, but on the world around us. Think for a moment: what might that impact be?
