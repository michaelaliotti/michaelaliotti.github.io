# Space

What we allow space for in our life is what we will have in our life.

If we allow space for hate, there will be hate. If we allow space for fear, there will be fear. If we allow space for pride, jealousy, and greed, there will be pride, jealousy, and greed.

If we allow space for love, there will be love. If we allow space for peace, there will be peace. If we allow space for humility, compassion, and generosity, there will be humility, compassion, and generosity.

What are you allowing space for in your life?
