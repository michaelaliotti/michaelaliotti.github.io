title: Take Control
---

What others do is outside our control, but what we do isn't. What others focus on is outside our control, but what we focus on isn't. How others feel is outside our control, but how we feel isn't.

The more time we spend trying to take control of the things that are outside our control, the less time we have to take ownership of the things we actually do have control over.

We must take control of what we can control---namely, ourselves.
