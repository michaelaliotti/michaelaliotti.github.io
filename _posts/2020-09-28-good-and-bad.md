title: Good and bad
---

It's dangerous to think we're good. Because, frankly, we're not. It's all too easy to slip into self-assured thoughts like, "I'm a good person." "I'm kind to people." "I don't steal or cheat." "I'm not as bad as that other person." And so on. Telling ourselves we're good, or believing we're good, is not good.

Likewise, it's just as dangerous to live in guilt, shame, or self-hatred. It's all too easy to slip into self-assured thoughts like, "I'm a failure." "I'm the worst." "I don't matter." "I deserve this." And so on. Punishing ourselves for our shortcomings, or believing it atones for our iniquities, is not good.

We must neither bask in our misperceived goodness nor wallow in our innate badness. For, this is a sure path to destruction.
