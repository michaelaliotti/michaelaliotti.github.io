# Discipline always wins

Motivation can be a powerful force in our lives. It can drive us to do amazing things --- things that we might not otherwise be able to do. It can keep us going when we're facing adversity. And it can reinforce our momentum when we're making progress. Motivation can light a fire inside us that feels (at least, in the moment) as if it will burn on indefinitely.

It would be great if motivation burned on forever. But it doesn't. It's temporary. And it's based on how we feel. When we don't have the motivation to do something, our everyday tasks can start to feel monotonous. Our routine can begin to wear on us. And the challenges we face can seem much more difficult, or even insurmountable.

So how do we persist when motivation is low or nonexistent? Discipline.

Discipline is a choice --- a conscious decision. It doesn't care how we feel. It doesn't make excuses. And it doesn't allow external factors to be a factor. Discipline does what needs to be done no matter what the circumstances are. Unlike motivation, which is trying to feel like doing something, discipline is doing something even when we don't feel like it.

What might be the impact of incorporating more discipline into your life? How might it affect your goals and aspirations? What else might become possible?
