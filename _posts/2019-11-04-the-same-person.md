Be it.

Whether at home, at work, at church, at the gym, in a crowd, alone, online, offline, succeeding, failing, enduring, in times of peace, in times of calm, in times of stress, in times of despair, dressed up, dressed down, with old friends, with new friends, with acquaintances, with people we'll meet once and never see again, etc.

Be the same person.
