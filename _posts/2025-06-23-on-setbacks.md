# On setbacks

There's no need to be discouraged when things don't work out, or you fail at something, or your idea is shot down, or your project fails, or others don't believe you can hit the goal.

If you know that you will continue to press on until you have accomplished the task, none of that matters. A setback is never the end. It's just part of being on the path to victory.
