title: The currency of character
---

It's our character that holds the most value --- not talent, not intelligence, not power, not popularity, not reputation, not achievement, not money, not possessions, not profession, not position --- the list goes on and on.

What if your character was your currency? How might that change your approach on life? What would become important for you? What would become unimportant for you?
