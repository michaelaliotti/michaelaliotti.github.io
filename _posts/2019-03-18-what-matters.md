title: What matters?
---

If we need to know that our work matters to others, we might want to consider asking ourselves how much it matters to us? And if our work really does matter to us, then it shouldn't matter if anyone else cares.

What's more important: That the work you do matters to someone else? Or that it matters to you? Maybe the question is: Are the answers to these two questions the same?
