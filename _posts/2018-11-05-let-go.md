title: Let go
---

We need to stop being so protective, so careful, and so guarded. Doing so holds us back. It encourages a "play it safe" mentality. We need to start taking more risks, more gambles, and more chances. Doing so sets us free. It encourages a "learn and adapt" mentality.

We need to stop doubting, fearing, and worrying. We need to start communicating what we're experiencing --- saying what we're thinking and expressing what we're feeling. We need to start living the life we want and stop living the life we settled for.

Playing it safe robs us of the opportunity to reach our fullest potential. In what areas of your life do you find yourself holding back? What would it take for you to let go? What would be the impact if you did? How are you going to do it?
