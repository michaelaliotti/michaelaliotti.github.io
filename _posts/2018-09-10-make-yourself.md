title: Make Yourself
---

We are who we decide to be. We are who we make ourselves into. We are not born destined to be something. We are born to determine our own destiny. The legacy we leave is the result.

Our lives are the product of the choices we make. How do you want your life to be? What is the vision you have? How might you start to take control of your own destiny?
