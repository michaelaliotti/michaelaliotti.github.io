title: The thing we should do first
---

Nothing.

It creates a buffer between what we've experienced and what we're going to do next. It creates an opportunity to detach and observe the situation from the outside. It creates a space to think clearly and make a sound decision. It creates the possibility for proper action --- for it is only when taking no action becomes a reaction that we can begin to take the best action.

When something happens, what do you do first?
