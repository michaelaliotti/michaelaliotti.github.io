title: How Much Is Enough?
---

We have everything we need. In fact, most of us have more than we need. (And yet, we still want more!) And it's precisely this pursuit of "more" that makes us feel like we have less --- like we can never have enough, be enough, or do enough.

But I would argue that we already have plenty. I would argue that we actually have "more" by having less. I would argue that the accumulation of things in this world is just a distraction from the true value and meaning we have to offer.

So, how much is enough? It's a lot less than we might want to admit.
