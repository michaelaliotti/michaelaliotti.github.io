title: Just because
---

Just because we want something doesn't mean we need it. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good (or right). Just because we have a thought doesn't mean we should act on it. Just because a person angers us doesn't mean they're bad (or we're good). Just because we have the technology doesn't mean we should use it. Just because something is easy doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

What things in your life are you doing "just because?"
