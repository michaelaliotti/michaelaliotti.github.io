# Fear is a lie

It wants you to hold back. It wants you to play small. It wants you to sell yourself short. It wants you to stay safe. It wants you to worry. It wants you to feel like you don't belong. It wants you to feel insignificant. It wants you to feel insecure. It wants you to feel like you're not good enough. It wants to keep you down. It wants to keep you from being free. It wants to keep you from yourself. It wants you to believe its lies.

Fear doesn't protect us. It prevents us.
