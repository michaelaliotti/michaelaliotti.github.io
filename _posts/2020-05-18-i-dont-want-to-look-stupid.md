# I don't want to look stupid

Many of us act like we have it all together. But the truth is, none of us do.

When was the last time you admitted you didn't know something? When was the last time you asked for help? When was the last time you admitted you were wrong or that you made a mistake (and, hopefully, apologized for it)?

Paradoxically, it is our fear of looking stupid that stifles our growth the most.
