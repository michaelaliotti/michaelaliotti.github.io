title: Appreciate the View (Even If It's Not Your Own)
---

We all have a model of the world. It's the lens through which we perceive everything around us. It's the filter through which we communicate what we're about. It's who we are, what we do, and what we believe. It's what makes us unique.

But our model of the world is also what can make us one-dimensional. It can blind us from seeing other angles. It can keep us from being open. It can shield us from things we disagree with or are simply unwilling to accept.

How might we be aware of others' model of the world? How might we appreciate their differences and unique perspectives? How does having an awareness and appreciation transform our model of the world?
