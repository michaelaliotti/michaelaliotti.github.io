# Leadership is a verb

Leadership has nothing to do with our title, position, or rank. It has nothing to do with our background, or the amount of experience we might have. It has nothing to do with our level of insight, or the ability to get others to do what we want. And it has nothing to do with being in charge of a team, an organization, or even a country.

Leadership has everything to do with our actions. It has everything to do with creating and fostering environments where others are learning, growing, and succeeding. It has everything to do with wanting the success of others over our own. And it has everything to do with the belief that we are better together, not alone.
