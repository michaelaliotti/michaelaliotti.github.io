Strive to walk in truth and love. Seek to understand. Respectfully stand up for what is right. Spend time alone. Spend time with others. Spend time in silence. Seek out challenge. Welcome adversity. Embrace struggle. Avoid anything easy. Be wary of comfort. Laugh at yourself. Laugh with others. Let go of judgment. Have fun. Make mistakes. Listen. Learn. Forgive. Help others. Let others help you. Be vulnerable. Be courageous. Be humble.
