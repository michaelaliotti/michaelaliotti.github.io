title: Run toward adversity
---

Adversity is inevitable. It's part of life. We've all faced it at some point. We might even be facing it right now. And it's all but guaranteed that we're going to face it again in the future. Some of us have experienced a lot of adversity in our lives. Others, not so much.

What's interesting about adversity is this: The more we avoid it, the harder it is to face it. But the more we face it, the less we fear it, and the more resilient we become. In order to thrive in adversity, we must look for it; seek it out; run toward it. We must get used to it.

What kind of person thrives in adversity? How will you respond when it strikes? How might regularly facing it be an advantage?
