# On habits

The things we do regularly stay with us (and most of the time we get better at them as well). And the things we don't do regularly start to fade away (we get rusty, lose the technique, or forget some steps).

The things we want to be good at must be practiced correctly and consistently. And the things we don't want to be good at (for example, any kind of bad habit), should not be practiced at all.

What good habit do you want to grow? What bad habit do you want to stop?
