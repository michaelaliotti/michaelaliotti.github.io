# Aim

The main reason people and teams don't achieve their goals isn't because they aren't capable. It's usually due to one of two things:

1. They have so many goals that there is no real aiming point
2. They are doing other things that have nothing to do with their goals

To achieve a goal, focus is needed. Eliminate anything that does not move you closer to the goal and watch how quickly progress is made.
