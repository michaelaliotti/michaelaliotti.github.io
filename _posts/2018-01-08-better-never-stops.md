title: Better never stops
---

Every day is an opportunity to be better. It's an opportunity to be a better spouse, a better parent, a better sibling, a better friend, a better listener, etc.

In order to be better at anything, we need to have a clear vision of what "better" is. We need to know what it means to be better, and what actions we should take. We must be willing to deal with potential setbacks and failures. Most importantly, we must never give up.

Here are some questions we should consider: What does "better" look like? What does it feel like? Why is it important? What are the values that drive us to be better? What might be one small step we can take right now to improve? What advice might the better version of ourselves one year from now give to us?

Being better is a never-ending journey. It's a lifelong commitment we make to ourselves. We must stay focused on our vision and let our values drive our actions. Let's strive to be the best version of ourselves each day. Remember, better never stops.
