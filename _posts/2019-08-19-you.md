# You

We must stop operating inside of this box --- this box of what's already been said and done. We must stop operating inside of this box of what others think is possible, or popular, or right.

The world doesn't need more people like each other. It needs more people who are different --- people with the courage and discipline to be who they are. No one else can be you better than you.
