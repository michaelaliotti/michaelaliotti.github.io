title: Strike the balance
---

When something matters to us, it means it's important. When it's important, we tend to focus on it. And in order to focus on something, we need to ignore everything else. This requires a healthy balance.

We can't be so focused that we lack awareness (helpful vs. harmful). We can't be so fixated that we aren't considerate (selfless vs. selfish). And we can't be so established that we don't dare (courageous vs. cautious).

The right amount of focus is critical: not enough, and we can't concentrate on anything meaningful; too much, and we miss everything else around us. How will you strike the balance?
