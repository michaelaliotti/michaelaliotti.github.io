title: What game are you playing?
---

If our goal is simply to get ahead in life, we're playing the wrong game. This is the external game. It's the game we tend to measure ourselves by; the game we can so easily get lost in; the game no one really wins. The external game is a distraction from the more meaningful (and rewarding) development of the inner self.

This is the internal game. It's the game of self-awareness and self-reflection; the game of empathy and perspective; the game of true growth and development. The internal game is not glorious; no one sees it. And while it's not easily recognized by those playing the external game, its presence can be felt.

What game are you playing? What impact is it having on your life? Are you winning?
