title: Focus is the new currency
---

We're a distracted society. We don't really notice it, though, because we're too distracted to notice. We're used to being busy. We're used to moving from one thing to the next at lightning speed. We're used to our attention being hijacked. We're used to checking our phones constantly throughout the day.

But living in a constant state of distraction is not a way to live. The new currency of today is focus. People who focus do meaningful work and create real value. People who concentrate think deeply and find real solutions. People who are present live in the moment and experience life fully.

The quality of our lives is richer and our contribution to society is greater when we block out distraction and focus on what matters most. Take a moment to think about what that might be. What are the benefits of focusing on the important stuff? What are the costs of distraction?
