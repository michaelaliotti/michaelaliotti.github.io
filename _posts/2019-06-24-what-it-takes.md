title: What it takes
---

It takes strength to show weakness, trust to be vulnerable, humility to admit a mistake. It takes courage to risk failure, confidence to not know, love to overcome hate.

It takes awareness to detach, mindfulness to learn, faith to see in the dark. It takes everything to want nothing, giving without expecting something, letting go for it to come back.

The more we try to protect ourselves, the less we are able to be ourselves. What will it take to let your guard down? How do you respond when others do the same?
