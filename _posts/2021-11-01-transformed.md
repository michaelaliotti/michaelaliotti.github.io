# Transformed

It's amazing how lives can be transformed when we make the conscious decision to love people. Not just some people --- like family and close friends --- but all people. People we don't even know. People we've only just met and may never see again. People who don't even know we exist, but somehow we've noticed them and thought about them, and have sent our hearts out to them. Everyone.

What's interesting is that it's not just their lives that are transformed when this happens. It's ours.
