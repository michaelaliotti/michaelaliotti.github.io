title: Slow down
---

We can only go so fast and put in so much effort and give so much time before we experience diminishing returns. Our energy turns to lethargy, our strength becomes a weakness, our sprint is reduced to a crawl. In a world that pushes us to do more, have more, and be more, take the time to slow down.
