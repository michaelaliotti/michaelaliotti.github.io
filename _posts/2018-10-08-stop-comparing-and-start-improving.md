title: Stop Comparing and Start Improving
---

Don't focus on what someone else can do. Focus on what you can do. Don't focus on being the best. Focus on doing your best. Don't focus on being better than everyone else. Focus on being better than yourself.

The moment you stop comparing is the moment you start improving. How might you shift away from comparing yourself to others? How might you shift toward improving yourself?
