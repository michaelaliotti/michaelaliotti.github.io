title: Embrace Change
---

Most of us don't like change. It can make us feel uncertain, out of control, and incompetent. It can disrupt routine, create more work, and cause frustration.

But change is inevitable. It is our opportunity to improve, evolve, and transform. It takes energy and effort to change, but it also takes energy and effort to resist it.

There is nothing wrong with being content with where we are, but there is everything wrong with staying there. How will you embrace change?
