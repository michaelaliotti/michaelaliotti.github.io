title: Wanting vs. being
---

There is a difference between wanting something and being something. For example, the difference between wanting to eat healthy and being a healthy eater; wanting to have confidence and being a confident person; wanting to lead and being a leader; etc.

If we want to change, we must stop wanting and start being. We must make the things we want be the things we are. We must change our narrative --- _I am a healthy eater. I am a confident person. I am a leader._ --- and align our actions with our identity.

When something is part of our identity, the decisions we make and the actions we take become clear. (It doesn't mean they will be any easier to execute on, though.) How do your decisions and actions align with who you are?
