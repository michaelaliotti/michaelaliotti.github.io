title: The Victim
---

It's never their fault. They always have an excuse. Their life is so much harder than everyone else's. They're negative. They complain. They like dragging others down. Self-pity is their friend.

The victim says:

"It doesn't matter how hard I try," or "Nothing is ever going to change," or "If only this person would stop," or "I wish this situation would just go away," or "Why does this always happen to me?"

The victim thinks:

Everything is unfair. Everything is a problem. Everyone is against them. Someone else or something else is to blame. It's best to do nothing. External factors are their only hope. Life happens to them.

Being the victim is a choice. What are you choosing to be?
