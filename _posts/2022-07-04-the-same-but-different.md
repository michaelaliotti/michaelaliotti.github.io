title: The same, but different
---

I'm not like you. And you're not like me. But we have a lot in common. I can feel pain. And so can you. I can feel happy. And you can, too. I can be wrong. And you can be right. I can say, "justice is served." And you can say, "that's not right." My truth might not be your truth. And your truth might not be mine. I might be angry. And you might be fine. I don't need to agree with everything you think, say, or do in order to associate with you.
