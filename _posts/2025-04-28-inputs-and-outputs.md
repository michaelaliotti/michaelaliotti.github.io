# Inputs and outputs

What we put in is (most of the time) what we get out.

Think about your inputs --- what you read, what you listen to, what you believe, etc. and compare them with your outputs --- how you are as a person, how you approach your work, how you look at life, etc.

If you are not satisfied with your outputs, how might you adjust your inputs to better reflect the output you wish to see? If you are satisfied with your outputs, how might you enhance your inputs?
