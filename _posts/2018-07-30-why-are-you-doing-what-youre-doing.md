title: Why are you doing what you're doing?
---

Doing things makes us feel productive. It makes us feel like we're progressing. And it makes us feel like we're contributing to something. We get enjoyment out of doing things, which makes us want to continue.

But we must remember to stop and ask ourselves, "Why?" Why are we doing these things? Why are they so important? Why are they so valuable? Why did we start in the first place? And why should we continue?

It's easy to get caught up in doing things and forget why we're doing them and who we're doing them for. How will you stay connected to the "why" and the "who" of the things you do?
