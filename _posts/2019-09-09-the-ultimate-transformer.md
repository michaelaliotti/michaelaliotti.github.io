title: The ultimate transformer
---

Anger wants to be met with anger. Fear with fear. Apathy with apathy. Frustration with frustration. Envy with envy. And so on.

But all of these are powerless against love.

Love turns anger into compassion. Fear into courage. Apathy into motivation. Frustration into patience. Envy into inspiration.

Love disarms negative emotions and bolsters positive ones (both in ourselves and in others). It is the ultimate transformer.

When we choose love, we choose to no longer tear each other down. We choose to lift each other up. We choose to transform.

What are you choosing?
