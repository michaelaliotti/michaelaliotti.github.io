# Comfort

A place we innately seek. A place where all is well. A place void of fear (but also void of courage). A place void of pain (but also void of lasting pleasure). A place of no growth. A place of nothing profound. A place where no one achieved anything worthwhile. A place where the best version of ourselves goes to die.
