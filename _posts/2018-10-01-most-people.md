title: Most people
---

Most people do just enough. Most people take the easy way. Most people limit themselves. Most people make excuses. Most people complain. Most people say they're too busy. Most people compare themselves to others. Most people quit when it gets hard. Most people want something. Most people do nothing about it.

Don't be like most people.

What makes you different? What sets you apart? What drives you? What inspires you? What challenges you? What humbles you? What takes your breath away? What brings you to tears? What exhilarates you? What strengthens you? What makes life worth living? What are you doing about it?
