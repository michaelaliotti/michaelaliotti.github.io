# Breaking through the wall

A lot of our life endeavors start out with enthusiasm. Just like at the beginning of a marathon. We're amped up to race. There's an incredible amount of energy those first few miles. We feel great. Everything is easy. And things are going as planned --- maybe even better than planned.

But then the race wears on. And our excitement starts to wear off. Our energy starts to wane. Our survival instincts kick in. And we start to question our resolve. It's that critical moment where we choose whether or not to continue. In a marathon, this moment is called "Hitting the Wall."

Hitting the wall is something that occurs in life, too. And it's what we do with this moment that determines our ability to adapt, change, and grow. How might you break through the wall in your life? What might be stopping you from seeing the other side?
