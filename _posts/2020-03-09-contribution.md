# Contribution

Whatever the situation; whatever the circumstance; whatever the outcome; whether right or wrong; whether success or failure; whether solution or problem --- we all play a part.

It can be easy to forget that we have a significant role in the things that show up in our lives. We must remember to ask ourselves how we contribute to them --- for we are all contributors.
