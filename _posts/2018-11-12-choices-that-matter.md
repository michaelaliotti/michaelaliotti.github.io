title: Choices That Matter
---

Our lives are full of choices. We make them every day. We make choices about what to eat, what to wear, what to buy, what to believe, what to say, etc. It has been estimated that we make roughly 35,000 choices in a single day!

Some choices we make are trivial, but others have a much larger impact---they affect us and those around us. These types of choices are fundamental to our improvement as humans and are the ones we should be focused on.

We can choose to make excuses for our actions, or we can own them. We can choose to tear others down, or we can lift them up. We can choose to be a victim of circumstance, or we can be the creator of our destiny.

Our lives are what they are because of the choices we make. How are your choices supporting you? How are they supporting others? What choices might you make differently to take further control of your life?
