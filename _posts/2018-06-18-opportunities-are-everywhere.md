title: Opportunities are everywhere
---

Each day is filled with opportunities, but we don't always notice them. And a lot of times, when we do notice them, we don't always act on them.

Think of some opportunities you have right now. What would be the benefit of following through on these opportunities? What would be the cost of not following through?

The best opportunities are the ones we create. How might you create your own opportunities instead of waiting for them?
