# Bring it

Where there is fear, bring courage. Where there is despair, bring hope. Where there is grief, bring healing. Where there is apathy, bring meaning. Where there is cruelty, bring kindness. Where there is falseness, bring truth. Where there is hate, bring love. Where there is dark, bring light.

What are you bringing?
