# Know yourself

We tend to focus on the external more than the internal. We tend to focus on what others notice about us more than what we notice about ourselves. We tend to focus on the destination more than the journey. And we tend to focus on what we do more than who we are.

Self-awareness and self-reflection are an important part of our lives. They're part of our growth as humans. We should continually evaluate ourselves to learn more about the person we are and the person we want to be --- even (and especially) if we are comfortable with our lives.

Take some time to reflect on who you are and/or who you want to be. What type of person are you? What words describe your identity? What do you stand for? What do you believe in? How might you adapt who you are and who you want to be as you grow?
