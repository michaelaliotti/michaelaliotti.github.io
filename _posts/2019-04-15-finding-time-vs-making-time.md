# Finding time vs. making time

There's a difference between finding time and making time.

Finding time is passive. It is hoping that there will be enough time to do all of the things you want to do.

Making time is proactive. It is prioritizing the things you want to do (which often requires removing things you're currently doing).

If something is truly important, then you'll make time for it. How might you make time for the important things in your life?
