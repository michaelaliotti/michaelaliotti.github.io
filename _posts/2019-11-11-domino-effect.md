"I hurt my hand, so I can't workout." "I didn't eat healthy this morning, so I'm going to ditch my diet today." "I didn't pass my test, so I'm going to skip studying."

We all get injured. We all eat something unhealthy at some point. We all fail tests in our life in one way or another. But it's the way we respond that matters most.

Things are going to happen that are less than ideal. That's life. What we choose to do next is paramount. The key is not allowing one bad outcome to lead to another.
