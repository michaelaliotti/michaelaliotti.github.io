title: Consistent, not instant
---

We live in a "now" society. We want change to happen quickly, and we expect results almost immediately. It's easy to see where these expectations come from: Want to lose weight? Do this exercise program for one week. Want to be entertained? Pull out a phone and fire up an app. Want to buy something? Go online and pay more money for faster delivery.

We live in a world where we can have what we want almost as soon as we decide we want it. This has led to unrealistic expectations when it comes to developing ourselves and creating meaningful change in our lives --- and that's because meaningful change doesn't happen overnight. Like most worthwhile things, it takes time, and it requires consistent work.

Consistent work requires discipline and focus. It requires patience and persistence. It requires making decisions based on the long-term. Most importantly, consistent work requires having an understanding that the little improvements we make each day are adding up to big improvements in the future. Consistent work is about playing the long game.

Thereâ€™s a reason why the term "quick fix" exists. While it may be fast, it's not meant to last. How might you move away from taking a quick fix approach and move toward doing more consistent work in order to create meaningful change in your life?
