# Everything for everyone

An accommodation for everyone's ideas often results in an idea no one really likes. A concession for everyone's vision often results in a vision no one really believes. A compromise for everyone's wants often results in something no one really wants.

When everything is for everyone, it becomes nothing to no one.
