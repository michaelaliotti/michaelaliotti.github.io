Want more money? Start saving it. Want more time? Stop wasting it. Want to be healthy? Exercise and eat right. Want to make an impact? Do something for someone else.

Don't like your job? Find a new one. Don't like your situation? Create a better one. Don't feel like you're improving? Work harder. Don't feel like doing something? Do it anyway.

Want something to be different? Go change it. Want to understand something better? Go learn it. Want to be more comfortable? Start doing more uncomfortable things.

Want something? Go get it. Otherwise, it's not going to happen.
