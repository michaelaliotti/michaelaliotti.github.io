# It doesn't just fall out of the sky

Almost always, the change you seek will have to come from within. Very rarely will it happen externally. If you want something to be different, you need to do something different --- change your attitude, behavior, opinion, perspective, etc. You must be willing to be wrong, unfazed by criticism, and let go of pride. Otherwise, change will not come.
