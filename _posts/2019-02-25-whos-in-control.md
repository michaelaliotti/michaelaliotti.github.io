title: Who's in Control?
---

We have an incredible amount of choice in our lives. Our decisions are our choice; our actions are our choice; our attitude is our choice; etc. And yet, sometimes it can seem as though the opposite is true.

Sometimes things happen that seem to be not of our own making. Sometimes it feels as though we have been manipulated into something not of our own volition. Sometimes choice doesn't feel like a choice.

But we must remember that we are the only ones who control our lives. We are the creators of our destiny; the deciders of our fate. We are the comfort; the pain; the joy; and the sorrow. We determine our experience.

We always have a choice; even when it seems like there is no other choice to be made. When it comes to your life, what are you choosing? And what might you be allowing others to choose for you?
