title: All Systems Go
---

We are all part of various systems. Families, friends, companies, teams, etc. are all systems. In order for these systems to function properly, each component that makes up the system must function together. Think of the human body. If a part is sick or injured, the entire system suffers, preventing it from operating at full capacity.

In a healthy system, each component fulfills its responsibility. In a healthy system, each component works together. In a healthy system, each component understands the responsibility of the other components. In a healthy system, each component relies on (and helps ensure) the health of the other components. In a healthy system, waste is removed.

Think about the systems in your life. Are they healthy? Are all the components working together? Which component are you? How might you improve the systems you're a part of?
