title: We Are Capable of More
---

I believe we have a purpose. And it's one that carries a great deal of meaning. It's our responsibility to be more. To be the best version of ourselves. And not just for ourselves, but for our families, our friends, others we don't even know, and for the world.

Imagine what our lives would be like if we upheld this responsibility. Imagine the impact it would have on our family and friends. Imagine the ripple effect of positive change it would have on others. And imagine the kind of world we would live in.

Picture the best version of yourself in your mind. What do you notice? What are you doing? What are you feeling? How can you move closer to this version of yourself? What do you need to do? Now, start doing it.
