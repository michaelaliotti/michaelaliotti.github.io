title: Create your purpose
---

Purpose is not something we find, it's something we create. It's not something we're born with, it's something we define and redefine over the course of our lives. And we aren't limited to having just one purpose, it's possible to have many.

Each purpose should have meaning (because it's possible to have purpose without meaning). It should add value to our lives and to the lives of others. And it should be the guiding light that keeps us on course when we're unable to see.

Take some time to reflect on your actions, activities, and behaviors. How aligned are they with your purpose? How might you adjust them to be better aligned? How will you know when it's time to redefine your purpose?
