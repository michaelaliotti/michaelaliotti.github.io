title: How to Get What We Want
---

How do we get what we want in our lives? It's really quite simple: we use our brain. Our brain is incredibly powerful---especially the part called the neocortex, which gives us the ability to imagine, dream, and visualize events in the future.

So, why is our ability to imagine, dream, and visualize events in the future so important? Because our brain is responsible for "connecting the dots" between where we are and where we want to be. When we focus on something we want, our brain instinctively helps us take steps toward it. It's similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy---the more we expect something to happen, the more likely it is to become a reality.

However, this works both ways. When we focus on something we don't want and approach it from the negative, our brain creates corresponding negative thoughts and actions. An example of this might be quitting a bad habit. Our aim should be to develop a good habit to replace the bad one, not just quitting the bad habit itself. Remember, the best way to move away from something negative is to move toward something positive.

So, let's focus on what we want, trust that we will take the necessary steps to get there, and enjoy the journey along the way. This is the key to getting what we want in our lives.

As a challenge, visualize an event in the future where you get what you want. How were you able to get it? What skills did you use? And what steps did you take?
