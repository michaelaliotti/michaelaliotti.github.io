title: Momentum builds success
---

Many of us have big goals we want to achieve in our lifetime, but we end up making little to no progress on them. Why is that? It's because we don't effectively break our big goals down into small goals. Instead, we look at where we want to be three months from now, six months from now, or a year from now. And while there's nothing wrong with that, the tendency can be to focus on just our long-term goals alone without any real plan for the daily goals we need to hit in order to get there.

One of the keys to successfully achieving our goals is to build momentum, but it can be hard to do that when our goals are so big. That's why it is paramount that we focus on what we need to do today, so we can be where we want to be in the future. In order to do that, we have to be able to break our goals down and make them manageable. In this way, we can generate the momentum necessary to keep us going and face the tough challenges we will inevitably encounter along the way.

Small wins each day make it easier to power through a tough obstacle. With this in mind, think about a big goal and imagine the timeline for that goal. What was the last thing you did just before you reached your goal? How about before that? And before that? Keep working backwards until you reach today. Now, focus on the first week. What might be some action steps you can take to start moving toward your goal and build momentum to carry you forward?
