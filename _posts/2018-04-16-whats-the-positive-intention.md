title: What's the positive intention?
---

We all have emotions, and we all handle them differently, but it's how we choose to act on them that ultimately makes the difference.

When it comes to negative emotions like anger, frustration, or nervousness, it can be helpful to think about the underlying positive intentions behind them. Ask yourself: What does the anger, frustration, or nervousness I'm experiencing want from me that's positive?

I'll use myself as an example: If I'm angry, the positive intention is usually that I want something good to happen. If I'm frustrated, it's generally because I want to be better at something. And if I'm nervous, it's almost always because I want to do a good job.

Asking this simple question allows us to better understand what we want, and helps us channel our energy in a positive direction. Try it for yourself!
