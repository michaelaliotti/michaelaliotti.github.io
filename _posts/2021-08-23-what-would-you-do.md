title: What would you do?
---

Too much of what we believe is tied to our ego. This makes it difficult for us to accept the truth in places where we've built our lives on something false. And it makes us unwilling to accept when we're wrong in places where we've built our lives on something we thought was right. What would you do if something you believed was true turned out to be false?
