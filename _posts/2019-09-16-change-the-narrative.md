# Change the narrative

You might not be confident right now, but that doesn't mean you can't be. You might not be patient right now, but that doesn't mean you can't be. You might not be disciplined right now, but that doesn't mean you can't be.

There are a lot of things you might not be right now, but that doesn't mean you can't be. It starts with believing that you can. And it continues with doing something about it. What are you doing to change the narrative?
