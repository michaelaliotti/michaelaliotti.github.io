Beware the pursuit of worldly success.

It is too often a dictator of decisions, a misguided measurement of value, and an arbitrary analysis of status.

It is too often a signpost of shortsightedness, a deluge of detours and distractions, and a common misconception of merit.

We must beware the pursuit of worldly success. For it can easily take us away from who we really are.
