# Your success is the success of others

In order to win, you need others around you to win. And you need the people around them to win, and so on... To do this, you need to help others be successful.

Too many of us are focused on our own success. And while we may win in the short-term, we will lose in the long-term because we aren't raising others up.

What are you doing to help others around you win?
