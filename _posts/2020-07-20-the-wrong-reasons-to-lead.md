# The wrong reasons to lead

For money. For power. For prestige. For fame. For recognition. For control. For freedom. For choice. For the ability to do whatever you want. Because you have to. Because people want you to. Because it's the next rung on the ladder. Because you have the answers. Because you know "the way."

Too many leaders become leaders for the wrong reasons. Why do you lead?
