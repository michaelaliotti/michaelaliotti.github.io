title: Help others
---

We don't raise our children to be almost as capable as we are. We raise them to be better than we are. To enter the world more equipped. Prepared to go further. Self-sufficient. Confident. Kind.

So, we give them everything we can. We tell them what we know. We let them make their own choices (knowing sometimes it will go good and sometimes it will go bad). And we help them learn from those experiences.

Most of all, we love them.

What if we approached all relationships this way? Not as if others were our children, but as if our desire to help others were similar to that of our children? What difference might it make?
