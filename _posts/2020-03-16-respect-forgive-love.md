title: Respect, Forgive, Love
---

Respect everyone; for if there is anyone we do not respect, there is a part of us that we do not respect in ourselves.

Forgive everyone; for if there is anyone we cannot forgive, there is a part of us that we cannot forgive in ourselves.

Love everyone; for if there is anyone we will not love, there is a part of us that we will not love in ourselves.
