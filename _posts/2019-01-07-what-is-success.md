title: What is success?
---

It seems we have the wrong idea about what success is.

It isn't money, having a big house, or taking fancy vacations. It isn't fame, having people like us, or being well known by everyone. It isn't how smart we are, how talented we are, or how accomplished we are.

So what is it?

I like to think success is a balance of two things:

1. Striving to be the best version of ourselves
2. Helping others do the same

This balance serves as a catalyst for unity and brings us together as a society.

How well do you strike the balance between improving yourself and helping others? How might you create more of this balance in your life? What does unity as a society look like to you?
