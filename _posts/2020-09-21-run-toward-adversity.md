title: Run Toward Adversity
---

Challenge and struggle are part of the human condition. And an attempt to eliminate it is futile. We can't buy our way out of it, or lie our way out of it, or numb and drug our way out of it. We can't ignore it, or suppress it, or run away from it. All of these attempts just make it worse.

The best way to deal with challenge and struggle is to face it head-on. Don't go around it. Don't go away from it. Don't try to go over or under it. Go right at it. Embrace it. Welcome it. Rejoice in it. And be grateful for it. For, it is better to face adversity than to never face it at all.
