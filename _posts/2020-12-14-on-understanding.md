title: On Understanding
---

The less we understand what a person thinks, or how a person acts, or what a person says, the more intense and relentless our pursuit of understanding their thoughts, ways, and words should be.

And we must not confuse the pursuit of understanding with agreement --- for it is possible to understand and still disagree. (And, more dangerously, it is just as possible to not understand and agree!)

There is nothing wrong with disagreeing with another person's opinions or beliefs. But there is everything wrong with not attempting to understand them. How well do you know the positions you yourself do not hold?
