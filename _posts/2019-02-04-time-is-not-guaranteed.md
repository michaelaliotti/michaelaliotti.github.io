# Time is not guaranteed

There are a lot of things in life that we can get back. For example, money: we spend it, but we also earn it. Gifts: we give them, but we also receive them. And how about love: we can love, but we can also be loved.

There is something that we cannot get back, though. It's called time. Each hour, minute, and second that passes is gone forever. There is no getting it back. And there is no guarantee of the amount we have left.

There are a lot of things in life that we can get back. Time is not one of them. How will you make the most of your time? How might you spend it differently if you knew how much you had left?
