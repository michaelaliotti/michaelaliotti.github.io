title: We're Human
---

We judge. We lie. We cheat. We compare. We manipulate to get our own way. We struggle with forgiveness. We struggle with fear. We struggle with loss. We struggle with feeling like we're not enough.

We want to be noticed. We want to be recognized. We want to be popular. We want to be remembered. We want to be successful. We want to win. We want to be perfect. We want to be loved.

We all do (and want) these things. Let's not be too proud to admit we're human.
