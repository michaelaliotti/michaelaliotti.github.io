title: Avoiding Pain
---

Our painful memories and past traumas need to be reconciled. The looming tasks and difficult people in our lives need to be faced. The uncomfortable conversations and unpopular decisions need to be made. The truth needs to be told (and it needs to be heard).

It's amazing the lengths we'll go to in order to avoid discomfort --- forget the past, seek out distractions, ignore people, avoid conversations, attempt to please everyone, say what others want to hear, etc. --- but a little pain now saves us from a lot of pain later.

What pain might you be avoiding?
