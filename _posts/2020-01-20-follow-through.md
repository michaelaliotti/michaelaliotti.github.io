# Follow through

Follow through builds trust. Lack of follow through erodes it. Follow through encourages honesty. Lack of follow through discourages it. Follow through honors commitment and responsibility. Lack of follow through denies it. Follow through requires discipline and sacrifice. Lack of follow through avoids it.

When we say we're going to do something, we should do it. When we don't, we hurt others. But mostly, we hurt ourselves. What might you need to follow through on more in your life? And what would the impact be if you did?
