# We are responsible for how we feel

The pressure we feel is the pressure we put on ourselves. The stress we feel is the stress we allow on ourselves. The anger we feel is the anger we hold in ourselves. The happiness we feel is the happiness we create for ourselves. The trust we feel is the trust we accept of ourselves. And the love we feel is the love we have for ourselves.
