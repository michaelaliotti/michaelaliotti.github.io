title: Do it differently
---

It's in our nature to seek connection; to find a community to which we belong; to relate to others that share our thoughts, opinions, and interests, etc. It brings a sense of comfort and safety to know that we are not alone; that we have support; that we fit in.

But to some extent we should not seek to conform. When we're alone, we have the chance to think clearly. When we don't have support, we have the opportunity to support ourselves. When we don't fit in, we can find our own way. The isolation can serve us.

If everyone is going to fit in --- sharing the same thoughts, opinions, and interests, etc. --- who is going to do the original thinking? Who is going to seek where others are not seeking? Who is going to pave the way for others to follow?
