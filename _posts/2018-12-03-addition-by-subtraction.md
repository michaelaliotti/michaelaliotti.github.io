title: Addition by Subtraction
---

A common theme in life is to add more to what is already there.

At work, this shows up as more people, more tools, more planning, more process, etc.---all of which lead to more complexity and less agility.

At home, this shows up as more possessions, more services, more activities, more commitments, etc.---all of which lead to more obligation and less time (and money).

What is often overlooked is the idea of taking away---to add by subtracting; to clear the clutter; to remove waste and complexity; to simplify what is already there.

Adding more is different from adding value. How might you add more value to your life by taking something away?
