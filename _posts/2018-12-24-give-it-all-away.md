title: Give It All Away
---

Dear Leaders,

Give it all away. Stop holding on to work and allow your team to grow.

Don't be the only one who knows how to do something. (And don't allow your team to have someone who is the only one who knows how to do something.)

Stop worrying about how things are done --- that's your team's job. Start focusing on what should be done and (more importantly) why it should be done.

Create an environment where everyone is heard and ideas are welcomed; where the team can share their knowledge, experience, and expertise.

Create an environment where everyone feels safe; where the team can share their weaknesses, failures, and fears. (You can start by sharing yours first.)

Know your team and celebrate with them. Recognize their successes and triumphs. Appreciate their hard work and dedication. Praise their effort.

Listen. Learn. Communicate. Trust. And get out of the way.
