# The pursuit of excellence

It isn't pretty. It isn't easy. And it doesn't end. It involves countless results that are less than excellent. But in the pursuit, the right combination of preparation, skill, and opportunity can create the environment needed to produce it.

This is what you see with someone who is excellent at their craft. Their efforts don't always produce excellence, but they remain undeterred. This is in contrast to the one who avoids failure (with the byproduct of avoiding excellence at the same time).

In what areas are you pursuing excellence?

In what areas might you be doing the opposite?
