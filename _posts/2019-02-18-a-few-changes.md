title: A few changes
---

Stop complaining and start doing. Others will decide for us if we don't decide for ourselves. We must find a solution, create change, and adapt.

Stop blaming and start owning. It doesn't matter who's fault it is; if it affects us, we're part of it, too. We must take ownership of ourselves and our situations.

Stop judging and start appreciating. When we stop judging others, we will stop judging ourselves. We must be grateful for what we have and focus on what we can do.

What might be the impact of making just one of these changes?
