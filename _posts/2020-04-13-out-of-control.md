title: Out of Control
---

The weather. The news. The outcome of a sporting event. What other people say. How other people behave. What other people think. What we say and do in regards to these things makes no difference on the outcome. None. And yet we tend to concern ourselves with them way more than the aspects of our lives that we actually control.

What about our attitude? What about the effort we put into our jobs and families? What about just doing the best we can with what we have every single day? There's no need to worry about the things we can't control. If we spend all our time worrying about the things we can't change, how will we have time to change the things we can?
