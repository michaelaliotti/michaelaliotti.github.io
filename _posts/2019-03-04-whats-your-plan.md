title: What's Your Plan?
---

Sometimes we put too much value on what others think we should do. And sometimes it feels like someone else's plan is better than our own. After all, if it works for them, it should work for us, right?

Someone else's plan might seem like a good way to go --- and it might even be helpful --- but it's their way. It's what worked for them. It's their ideas, experiences, and beliefs. It's what they think is best.

It's not that their plan isn't valid, but when it comes to our lives, we know what's best (whether we believe it or not). No one can know us better than ourselves. No one can understand us better than ourselves.

The ability to achieve what you want is already within you. How might you unleash that ability? What existing skills can you leverage? What new skills do you need to develop? What's your plan?
