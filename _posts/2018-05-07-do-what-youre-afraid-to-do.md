title: Do What You're Afraid to Do
---

There should be at least one thing we do each day that makes us feel a little nervous or uneasy.

Why? Because doing the things we're afraid to do makes us better. Because it helps shape us into who we are, and who we can be. And because there is no growth in avoiding the things we fear.

What's the one thing you're afraid to do right now? What do you stand to gain by facing this fear? What do you stand to lose if you don't?
