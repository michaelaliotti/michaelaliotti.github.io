If you are uncomfortable around others, others will likely be uncomfortable around you. If you are untrusting of others, others will likely be untrusting of you. If you are unkind toward others, others will likely be unkind toward you.

Often, the behavior we experience from others is merely a reflection of our own. How might you change what you see in the mirror?
