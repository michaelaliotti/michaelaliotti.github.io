# Bad is easy, good is hard

Hate is easy, love is hard. Ignorance is easy, knowledge is hard. Laziness is easy, effort is hard. Anger is easy, calmness is hard. Fear is easy, courage is hard. Conflict is easy, peace is hard. Selfishness is easy, selflessness is hard. Despair is easy, hope is hard.
