# Something to offer

A smile, a shoulder to cry on, a helping hand. A sounding board, a listening ear, a genuine interest to understand.

An honest response, a thoughtful gesture, a powerful question. A quiet place, a safe space, a moment of decompression.

We all have something to offer. So, don't hold it back. You never know who might need it.
