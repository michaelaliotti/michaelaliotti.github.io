# Next play

Too often we let previous outcomes affect what happens next. When things don't go well, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking it will happen again. And when things _do_ go well, it can be easy to fall into the trap of complacency and not prepare for what's next.

This is why it's important to separate the outcome from the learning.

Meeting didn't go well? Don't dwell on it. Learn from it and attack the next meeting with the new perspective you just gained. Project came out great? Don't dwell on it. Celebrate it, learn from it, and attack the next project with the new perspective you just gained.

Good or bad, whatever happened in the past is over. Next play.
