title: Our biggest obstacle is ourselves
---

A fulfilling life is not just for a select group of people. It is for all of us. But it takes a high sense of self-awareness, as well as a high sense of awareness of others. And it takes overcoming the inner blocks that prevent us from achieving what we want in our lives.

We all have these inner blocks. Some we aren't aware of. Some we choose to live with. And some we choose to move past. But it's our choice whether we want to allow our inner blocks to stop us, or to go beyond them and fully realize the kind of life we want to have.

Imagine you have just successfully overcome one of your inner blocks. How were you able to do that? What values have entered into your life as a result? What becomes possible now that you are no longer hindered by this inner block?
